# About
Organises your pictures by reading the EXIF data, with the option to choose to sort by location, or by date taken. Only works on JPEG for now.

## Installation
This project requires the sklearn library. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install sklearn
```

## How to use
**BACKUP ALL PHOTOS FIRST**

Move the desired photos into a folder, and select your folder using the gui.
If your photos have location data, check the _Sort by location_ checkbox, and choose your scale. Defaults to sorting by date taken.
After running the code, rename your folders as desired.
